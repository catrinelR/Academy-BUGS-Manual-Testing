A practice project with a mockup e-commerce site for discovering 25 hidden bugs inside with the scope of revealing the different types of bugs that commonly occur in websites and apps: functional, performance, visual, content and crash. /
I created 25 bug reports in Jira and exported them via Better PDF Exporter for Jira Cloud.
